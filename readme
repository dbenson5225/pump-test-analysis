This repository contains a number of different codes to automatically find optimal parameters for different kinds of aquifer pumping tests.  Three coding languages are provided here: R, python, and matlab. Within each language folder, there are several examples, each including data from a different test.  All tests are described in the paper listed below.  Please cite the paper if you use these codes.  Also please notify the corresponding author (dbenson@mines.edu) if you make modifications to the code(s).
The codes are constructed with readability as the directing principle.  Modifications for speed will be simple for adept coders: CPU and parallel implementations are straightforward.
The matlab codes require that a separate file contains the function for calculating the model drawdowns and comparing to observed data.  This function is called from a main program (which has the word "main" in the filename).  For python, there is only one file (ending with .py) that needs to be run in the python environment.  In R, ...
